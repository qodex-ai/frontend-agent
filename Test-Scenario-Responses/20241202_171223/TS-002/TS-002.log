visit app.qodex.ai
I'll help you navigate to app.qodex.ai by entering it in the Firefox address bar:
I see that the page has redirected to www.app.qodex.ai, and it appears to be showing a login/signup interface similar to the pricing page. Since this is the application portal, you would need to have an account to proceed further. The page shows the same pricing tiers and features as we saw before, with options to:

1. "Get Started" for the free Hobby tier
2. "Get started" for the Pro tier
3. "Talk to Sales" for the Enterprise tier

Would you like to explore any specific part of the application portal or would you like to try something else?
